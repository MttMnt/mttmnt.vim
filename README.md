# Dependencies
You will need to insall the following packages:
`curl, clangd, python3, luarocks`



Also, you will need a nerd font. I use this:
`https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/releases/download/v3.4.0/JetBrainsMono.zip`
and set it as your terminal font.



You may need to use a terminal that supports truecolor, like:
- kitty
- wezterm
- alacritty
- iterm2
- ghostty
